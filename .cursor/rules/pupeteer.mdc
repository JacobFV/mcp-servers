When using Puppeteer for web interactions, please:

1. Navigate to the target website
2. Take a screenshot immediately after navigation to verify the page loaded. if needed wait for it to load
3. Use direct position-based clicking where possible
4. Use precise CSS selectors when possible (ID, class, or element+attribute combinations)
5. If direct selectors fail, try JavaScript evaluation with document.querySelector or XPath
6. Take screenshots after each significant interaction
7. Describe what you observe on the page after each step
8. When targeting text-containing elements, use JavaScript evaluation instead of :contains() selectors

If attempting complex interactions, provide step-by-step guidance to yourself on what you're trying to accomplish.
